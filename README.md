# ShapeClassifier

This project aims to classify hand drawn two dimensional shapes by training an appropriate CNN model with a suitable dataset and subsequently validating both the modelâ€™s accuracy and
loss when presented with previously unseen data.

The design of the model has been completed using a combination of a jupyter notebook and regular Python script to produce the required functionality and results.
